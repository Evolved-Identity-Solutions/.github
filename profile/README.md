**IdentityRM** is the Identity Context Layer for AI agents — giving them the context to decide correctly and the audit trail to prove it.

We're building tools for developers who need to govern AI agents in enterprise environments: hierarchical org management, role-based access control, multi-IdP federation, and natural language administration — all accessible through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

### Open Source

- **[identityrm-ai-client](https://github.com/Evolved-Identity-Solutions/identityrm-ai-client)** — Reference AI client for natural language identity management, powered by Claude and MCP. Apache 2.0.

### Built by

A small team of identity veterans with 25+ years of enterprise IAM experience, including the creators of Okta Access Gateway (formerly SPGateway). Learn more on our [About page](https://www.identityrm.com/about).
